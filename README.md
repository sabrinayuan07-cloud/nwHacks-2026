# Ripple

A wellness community app built by students, for students. This is our hackathon project for nwHacks 2026.

**Why Ripple?** Small impacts make big changes. Just like our mascot the otter - one small action can ripple out and create meaningful connections. We built this because we believe in the power of small moments to make a big difference in someone's day.

## What It Does

So basically, we wanted to make something that actually helps students. College can be rough - there's a lot of pressure, stress, and sometimes it feels like you're just going through the motions alone. We built Ripple to create a space where students can connect with each other around wellness activities and support.

The app lets you:

- Join wellness events (everything from cooking workshops to meditation sessions)
- Chat with other students anonymously or reveal your identity when you're comfortable
- Create a profile that can be completely anonymous or public
- Share encouragement messages with the community
- Browse upcoming events and find ones that match your interests

## Tech Stack

- React Native with Expo (because we wanted it to work on both iOS and Android without too much hassle)
- Expo Router for navigation
